# Flask To Do List
This is a **Python** to do list web app made following the [free code camp tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1RJmh_OqeA).

To make this simple project I learned about *API* and template manipulation using **Flask**, **Jinja2** and **HTML/CSS**.

Besides, I learned how to use **SQLite** database and how to deploy it, using [Render](https://render.com/).
You can access the project [here](https://todolistjoao.onrender.com/).

<sub>*Note that as I used the free deploying system of Render, the data is persisted for just a few hours.*</sub>
