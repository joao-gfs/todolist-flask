# todolist-flask
A python to do list web app made following the [free code camp tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1RJmh_OqeA).

To make this simple project I learned about API and template manipulation using Flask, Jinja2 and HTML/CSS.
Besides, I learned how to use sqlite database and how to deploy it, using [Render](https://render.com/).
Access the project [here](https://todolistjoao.onrender.com/). 
Note that as I used the free deploying system of Render, the data is persisted for just a few hours.
